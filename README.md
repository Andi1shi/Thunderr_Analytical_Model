# Thunderstorm Simulation and Optimization
Description
This MATLAB script is designed for simulating horizontal mean wind velocity caused by traveling downbursts. It combines three velocity fields: radial impinging jet, downburst translational, and ambient ABL (Atmospheric Boundary Layer) wind velocities. The model employs a parametric-analytical approach for spatiotemporal reconstruction of downburst events and optimizes downburst dimensions and kinematics against real measurements using the Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm.
